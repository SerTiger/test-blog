                        <p>
                            Right now NFT in most cases is used to create digital art. But that technology has a big potential behind it. For example, NFT can be used as a digital passport for personality verification into the digital world and after that procedure you can receive NFT. And that saves time, because you pass the KYC procedure just one time and other times you don’t need to do this, because you can prove your KYC by the NFT token that you receive after passing it the first time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So there is just one example, but there can be a lot of them. And that technology serves for attention from investors. So we trying to choose most interesting projects from that area and help you to participate into it.
