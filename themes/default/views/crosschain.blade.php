                    <p>Blockchains were built to save consistency of data and improve settlement security purposes.</p>
                    <p>Big potential of blockchain technologies and their development brings to the world new types of
                        blockchains different from Bitcoin. Goals of each blockchains are different and data exchange
                        between blockchains has become necessary.</p>
                    <p>Cross-chain is a technology that improves the connection between different blockchain networks by
                        allowing the exchange of information and value.</p>

                            We in OXO Believe in the great power of blockchain technologies but for creating new economy
                            networks data should be interchangeable.
                        </p>
                        <p>That creates the need to build bridges between different blockchains. What allows us to transfer
                            & create new types of digital assets.</p>
                        <p>Cross-chain technology also allows users to overcome common trade-offs among distributed
                            platforms and use different benefits of various consensus mechanisms so they can choose
                            technology which will help and make their goals a reality.</p>
