                    <h2>Transparency to Economics with Decentralized Finance</h2>
                    <p>DeFi - Decentralized Finances itâ€™s application built on blockchain technology.</p>
                    <p>Decentralized Finances originated from untrust of people to traditional financial institutes. And DeFi was born with the goal to create more: transparent, open, non-custodial, composable and decentralized financial instruments.</p>
                    <p>Most projects don't meet all the points described above. Because DeFi is really new technology and most of the teams partly work with their applications on early stages of product development. But all of the developers seek to let go of control of its protocol and enable the community to manage the application and transform the organization into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization.</p>
